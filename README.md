# ```apitran```
A Linux toolkit for handling signals over the automatic picture transmission (APT) protocol.

## Warning!
I am returning to this project after two years to finally commit it the love it deserves.

I am doing a complete refactor, moving from Python to C++. I have chosen to develop on ```origin/master```. If anyone needs the old Python version, I have moved it to ```origin/python3-old``` where I plan to let it remain indefinitely.

Presently the old Python is retained on this branch *only* for my convenience insofar as being a reference. Expect it to be removed soon.
